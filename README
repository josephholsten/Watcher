Watcher
-------

The watcher watches you. It consists of

- Watcher: executable which runs isightcapture and saves its output
- com.josephholsten.Watcher.plist: LaunchAgent script to regularly run Watcher
- install.sh: install script
- uninstall.sh: uninstall script, deletes captured images as well
- README: this file

Requirements
============

- [imagesnap](https://github.com/aw/imagesnap): executable which
  captures an image from your isight camera

Installing
=======

Just run install.sh from the source directory

  % install.sh

You'll start getting a shit ton of boring images in
`/var/lib/Watcher/Pictures`. A script to delete these as fast as they
are created is left as an exercise for the reader.
