Watcher
-------

The watcher watches you. It consists of

- isightcapture: put this in your path
- Watcher: also goes in your path
- local.Watcher.plist: this goes in ~/Library/LaunchAgents

You may need edit things so they have the right file paths. Actually, unless you're me, you may consider everything I describe as a thing you may do as a thing that your life depends upon. Or you may be a punter.

Running
=======

Once you've got everything set up, you can tell launchd to load the watcher by running

  % launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/local.Watcher.plist

Or just restart your machine, log in, and drop your laptop in a bathtub.

You'll start getting a shit ton of boring images in ~/Pictures/Watcher. A script to delete these as fast as they are created is left as an excersise for the reader.
